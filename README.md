# SENTIMENT-ANALYSIS-OF-REVIEWS

Overview
This project focuses on building a sentiment analysis model specifically designed for analyzing food product reviews. Using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning, the system can classify customer reviews as either Positive or Negative. The goal is to help food businesses, e-commerce platforms, and analysts quickly identify customer sentiment without manually reading thousands of reviews. This approach can save time, improve customer feedback handling, and allow businesses to make data-driven improvements to their products.

Dataset
The dataset contains thousands of customer food reviews collected from an online marketplace. Each entry includes:
Product ID â€“ A unique identifier for each product.
User ID â€“ The reviewerâ€™s identifier.
Profile Name â€“ Name of the reviewer.
Helpfulness Score â€“ Number of people who found the review helpful.
Score â€“ Star rating given by the customer (1â€“5).
Time â€“ Date of the review.
Summary â€“ Short review summary.
Text â€“ Full review text.
For sentiment classification, the ratings are mapped into two categories:
Positive sentiment â†’ Scores of 4 or 5.
Negative sentiment â†’ Scores of 1 or 2.
Reviews with a score of 3 (neutral) are excluded from the training data to maintain a clear distinction between positive and negative classes.

Approach
The project follows these steps:
Data Cleaning
Removal of missing or duplicate entries.
Elimination of punctuation, HTML tags, and special characters.
Conversion of all text to lowercase for consistency.

Text Preprocessing
Tokenization to split sentences into individual words.
Removal of stopwords (e.g., "the", "is", "and") to keep only meaningful words.
Lemmatization to reduce words to their base form.

Feature Extraction
Use of TF-IDF Vectorization to convert text into numerical features that can be processed by a machine learning model.

Model Building
Logistic Regression is used as the classification algorithm because it is simple, fast, and performs well for text classification tasks.

Model Evaluation
The dataset is split into training and testing sets to measure accuracy and performance.

Deployment with Streamlit
A web interface is created using Streamlit, allowing users to type a review and instantly see whether it is classified as positive or negative.

Technologies Used
Python â€“ Main programming language.
Pandas & NumPy â€“ Data handling and numerical computations.
Scikit-learn â€“ Machine learning model building and evaluation.
NLTK â€“ Natural Language Processing tools for text cleaning.
Streamlit â€“ Web application framework for deployment.

Output
When a user enters a review into the application, the system processes it, applies the trained model, and predicts whether the sentiment is ðŸ˜Š Positive or ðŸ˜ž Negative, giving instant results in a clean, user-friendly interface.
